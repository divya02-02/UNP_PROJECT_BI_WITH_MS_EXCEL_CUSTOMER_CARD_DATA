Credit Card Data Analysis Dashboard 

This is a group project using Excel to analyze credit card data and user demographics.
I contributed by creating a pivot table analyzing gender distribution across age groups.
The data is categorized into ranges (20–70 years) and split by gender (Male/Female).
The majority of users fall between 50–70 years of age.
Totals: 603 females, 125 males, 728 individuals overall.
This section helps identify user segments and demographic trends.
The dashboard includes interactive charts and filters for deeper insights.
It supports financial analysis and improves understanding of customer behavior.MS EXCEL PROJECT FILE : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zas-2ZkfFhnNaFtmPFiZPEGcPQ3r9DPi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111662082670639979077&rtpof=true&sd=true
